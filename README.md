## Feature Roadmap

Our goal is to build a product with the following capabilities, mirroring the powerful and user-friendly experience of Screen Studio.

### Core Recording

- **High-Quality Screen Capture**: Record your entire screen, a specific application window, or a custom area.
- **Webcam & Audio**: Overlay your webcam on your recording, and capture audio from your microphone, system audio, or both.

### The "Studio" Magic: Automatic Post-Processing

This is where the magic happens. These features work automatically to make your recordings look amazing with minimal effort.

- **Automatic Pan & Zoom**: The recorder intelligently tracks your cursor, automatically creating smooth pan and zoom animations to keep the most important action in focus.
- **Smooth Cursor Movement**: Say goodbye to jerky mouse movements. Captrix will analyze and transform your cursor path into a smooth, cinematic glide. The cursor size can also be adjusted post-recording.
- **Motion Blur**: Automatically applies motion blur to fast-moving elements, giving your video a professional, high-quality feel.
- **Automatic Audio Enhancement**: Removes background noise from your microphone and normalizes audio levels for clear, consistent sound.

### Editing & Customization

- **Simple Video Editor**: A timeline-based editor for basic trimming, cutting, and speeding up parts of your recording.
- **Manual Zoom Control**: Manually add, remove, or fine-tune the automatic zoom points to get the perfect result.
- **Branding & Styling**:
  - Add a custom wallpaper or background.
  - Customize the window appearance with rounded borders and drop shadows.
  - Instantly switch between horizontal (16:9) and vertical (9:16) aspect ratios, with all animations adjusting automatically.

### Export & Share

- **Optimized Exports**: Export your recording with presets optimized for web, social media, or other video editors.
- **Multiple Formats**: Save your final video as a high-quality MP4 or a highly-optimized GIF.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy your video or GIF to the clipboard and paste it anywhere.
